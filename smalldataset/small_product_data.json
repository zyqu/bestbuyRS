To keep them protected, He appointed the most human of all angels, the Grigori, to watch over them from heaven. Known to some as \"The Watchers,\" the Grigori obeyed God's wishes and kept a watchful eye on the humans. But as the years passed, these vigilant angels became captivated by the lives humans led, full of freedom, passion and privilege. This fascination soon grew into obsessive feelings of longing, desire and lust, and on one fateful day, the Grigori turned away from God and descended to Earth. Heaven's highest order, the Council of Elders, became infuriated when they learned of the betrayal. The Council's rage enflamed when they discovered that the fallen angels had taken in the daughters of men, deviating mankind from God's plan. To set matters right, the Council decided to send a horrific flood to annihilate the entire human race. One man objected to this decision \u0097 Enoch, a righteous scribe whose passion persuaded God to bring him to Heaven while still mortal. The Council heard Enoch's pleas and agreed to spare mankind on the one condition \u0097 Enoch must capture the fallen angels and bring them back to Heaven to be imprisoned. Upon his return to Earth, Enoch meets Azazel, one of the seven fallen angels. Azazel refuses to return to Heaven; instead, he goes into hiding with the other angels and warns Enoch not to follow.
